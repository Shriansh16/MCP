# Normal MCP Server (HTTP+SSE Transport)

The original MCP implementation used HTTP + Server-Sent Events (SSE), which had these characteristics:

- **Two separate endpoints**: Required maintaining two separate endpoints - one for SSE connections and another for POST requests (`/messages`) [Understanding MCP Recent Change Around HTTP+SSE – ceposta Technology Blog](https://blog.ceposta.com)
- SSE endpoint (/sse): Used for the server to send messages TO the client (server → client)
- HTTP POST endpoint (/messages): Used for the client to send messages TO the server (client → server)
**The Problem with This Approach** 

1. Two connections to maintain: One SSE connection for receiving, one HTTP connection for sending
2. Complexity: You need to handle two different types of connections
3. Infrastructure issues: Some proxies, load balancers, or firewalls don't handle SSE well
4. Stateful: The server must remember which SSE connections belong to which clients

This created a bidirectional communication system using two separate channels.
- **Two separate connections**: One for server→client communication (SSE) and one for client→server communication (HTTP POST)
- **Complex setup**: Client connects to an SSE endpoint, server responds with an "endpoint event" telling the client what URI to use for sending messages

# Streamable MCP Server (Streamable HTTP Transport)

MCP introduces Streamable HTTP for remote servers in recent updates. In simple terms, this means we don't need to have two separate endpoints. The client can stream responses from the server directly from the `/messages` endpoint. [Understanding MCP Recent Change Around HTTP+SSE – ceposta Technology Blog](https://blog.ceposta.com)

Key advantages of streamable MCP servers:

- **Single endpoint**: The server can decide whether it will respond with a streamable response or standard HTTP response [Understanding MCP Recent Change Around HTTP+SSE – ceposta Technology Blog](https://blog.ceposta.com)
- **Simplified architecture**: Plain HTTP implementation - MCP can now be implemented in a plain HTTP server without requiring separate SSE support, simplifying server implementation
- **Better infrastructure compatibility**: Being "just HTTP" ensures compatibility with standard middleware and infrastructure
- **Flexible implementation**: Supports both stateless and stateful server implementations
- **Dynamic streaming**: The server can dynamically decide whether to respond with a standard HTTP response or upgrade to streaming based on the specific interaction needs

# Why the Change?

The HTTP+SSE approach had limitations including:
- Requiring maintaining two separate connections/endpoints
- Necessitating persistent connections making stateless implementations difficult
- Having limited compatibility with some infrastructure and middleware

The streamable HTTP transport represents a significant improvement because:
- It simplifies the protocol by using a single connection point
- Allows servers to be more flexible about when to use streaming vs. one-time responses
- Enables completely stateless server implementations when appropriate

In essence, streamable MCP servers offer a more modern, flexible, and infrastructure-friendly approach to implementing the Model Context Protocol while maintaining all the functionality of the original specification.


# Yes, Single Endpoint is an Advantage, BUT...

You're right that streamable MCP uses one endpoint instead of two, but there are several other important advantages:

## 1. Flexibility in Response Type

**Old way (HTTP+SSE):**  
The `/sse` endpoint ALWAYS had to stream, the `/messages` endpoint ALWAYS gave single responses  

**New way (Streamable):**  
The same `/messages` endpoint can choose on each request whether to:  
- Give a simple one-time response, **OR**  
- Start streaming multiple messages  

## 2. Stateless Capability

**Old way:**  
Server HAD to remember which SSE connections belonged to which clients (stateful)  

**New way:**  
Server CAN be completely stateless if it wants - it doesn't need to track connections  

## 3. Better Infrastructure Compatibility

**Old way:**  
SSE connections can be problematic with:  
- Load balancers  
- Proxies  
- Firewalls  
- CDNs  

**New way:**  
It's "just HTTP" so it works everywhere HTTP works  

## 4. Dynamic Decision Making

This is a big one! With streamable HTTP:  
- The server can look at each request and decide: "Do I need to stream back multiple messages for THIS particular request, or just send one response?"  
- Example: A simple "ping" might get one response, but a "run complex analysis" might need to stream progress updates  

## 5. Simpler Implementation

**Old way:**  
Developers had to implement TWO different connection types  

**New way:**  
Developers only need to implement HTTP (which they already know)

## Analogy

Think of it like this:  

**Old way (HTTP+SSE):**  
Like having a separate phone line for incoming calls and outgoing calls - always need both  

**New way (Streamable):**  
Like having one phone that can handle both quick calls AND long conference calls, depending on what you need at the moment
