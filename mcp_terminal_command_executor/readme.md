# MCP Client - Gemini AI Bridge

## Overview

The code creates a bridge between:

- **MCP Server**: Provides tools/functions that can be called
- **Gemini AI**: Processes user queries and decides when to use tools
- **User**: Interacts through a chat interface

## Workflow

1. **User Input Processing**: Formats the user's query for Gemini
2. **AI Analysis**: Gemini analyzes the query and decides if tools are needed
3. **Tool Execution**: If Gemini requests a tool call:
   - Extracts tool name and arguments
   - Calls the MCP server to execute the tool
   - Gets the result back
4. **Response Generation**: Sends tool results back to Gemini for final response
5. **Output**: Returns the formatted response to the user

## How It All Works Together

- **Startup**: User runs the script with an MCP server path
- **Connection**: Client connects to the MCP server and discovers available tools
- **Tool Registration**: Tools are converted to Gemini format and registered
- **Chat Loop**: User can ask questions
- **AI Processing**: For each query:
  - Gemini analyzes if tools are needed
  - If yes, executes tools via MCP server
  - Generates response based on tool results
  - Returns formatted answer to user

## The Roles

### Python MCPClient
The actual MCP client that:
- Handles MCP protocol communication
- Connects to MCP server via stdio
- Executes tool calls on the MCP server
- Manages the MCP session

### Gemini AI
The intelligent decision maker that:
- Analyzes user queries
- Decides which tools to use (if any)
- Generates natural language responses
- Never directly communicates with the MCP server

## The Flow in Detail

1. User asks: "What files are in my directory?"
2. MCPClient receives the query and sends it to Gemini along with available tool descriptions
3. Gemini analyzes and responds: "I need to call the list_files tool"
4. MCPClient receives Gemini's tool request and:
   - Extracts tool name (`list_files`) and arguments
   - Makes the actual MCP call to the server
   - Gets results back from MCP server
5. MCPClient sends the tool results back to Gemini
6. Gemini processes the results and generates a user-friendly response
7. MCPClient returns the final response to the user

## Important Notes

- Gemini never touches the MCP server directly. It only:
  - Receives tool descriptions
  - Decides which tools to use
  - Processes tool results
  - Generates responses

- The Python MCPClient is the bridge that:
  - Speaks MCP protocol to the server
  - Speaks Gemini API to the AI
  - Orchestrates the entire workflow
